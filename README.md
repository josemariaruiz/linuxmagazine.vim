Vim syntax file for Linux Magazine format.

I suppose that only a few dozens of Linux Magazine authors will benefit from this syntax file, but I find painful to write anything using Linux Magazine's file format without some help. I created a emacs syntax file before but now I'm exploring Vim and this is my first try in creating a Vim "plugin".
